This is a simple info file.
It has nothing but ... this:

Once upon a modem time in a BBS far, far away,
There lived a sysop known for his coding savvy.
His handle was Raven, a dark and brooding soul,
His terminal filled with tales that made the users scroll.

One midnight dreary, as the sysop coded away,
A message appeared, he couldn't help but say,
"Who is this interrupting my work so late?"
And then he saw the sender's handle, "Nevermore 8-bit."

"What do you want?" Raven asked in frustration,
But all he saw was the cursor's animation.
He typed again, "Speak up, my friend, what's your request?"
But again, the sender remained silent at best.

The sysop grew weary, but also intrigued,
By this mysterious sender, he was beleaguered.
He opened a chat room and invited the sender in,
Hoping for answers, for a beginning or an end.

And then it happened, a response came at last,
The sender wrote, "Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore.'"
The sysop was puzzled, "What does this mean?"
He typed again, but the sender was nowhere to be seen.

And so the Raven, he was left to ponder,
About the strange message, that was beyond the border.
The sender never returned, and the sysop was left alone,
With a message that echoed, "Nevermore" on his own.

And as the sysop sat there in the still of the night,
He couldn't help but wonder if the sender was right.
The message haunting, like a bird of ill omen,
And so the sysop's handle, Raven, was forever chosen.
